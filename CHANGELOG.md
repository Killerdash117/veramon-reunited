# Veramon Reunited Changelog

This file tracks all notable changes to the Veramon Reunited Discord bot.

## Version System Explanation

Veramon Reunited uses a precise versioning system to indicate the scope of each update:

| Version Format | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| `0.05+` | Major update with significant new features |
| `0.01+` | Minor update with improvements to existing features |
| `0.0001+` | Bug fixes and small patches |
| `1.0+` | New generation/significant evolution of the bot (used sparingly) |

This approach allows the version number to communicate the scale and impact of each release.
