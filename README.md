<summary><h3>🛠️ Key Technologies</h3></summary>

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **discord.py** | Python library for Discord API interaction |
| **Discord UI Components** | Buttons, selects, and modals for interactive gameplay |
| **SQLite** | Local database storage for user data and game state |
| **JSON** | Data storage for game assets |
| **Actor System** | Battle state management architecture |
| **python-dotenv** | Environment variable management |
| **SQLAlchemy** | ORM for database interactions |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>⚙️ Core Systems</h3></summary>

#### Discord Integration

The bot is built entirely around Discord's interface capabilities:

- **Slash Commands** - All user interactions start with / commands
- **Button Interactions** - Battle controls, team management, and navigation
- **Embeds** - Rich visual displays for battles, profiles, and game information
- **Ephemeral Messages** - Private responses for sensitive information
- **Component Interactions** - Selection menus, modals for user input

#### Actor-Based Architecture

The battle system utilizes an actor-based architecture, providing:

- **Isolation** - Each battle runs in its own isolated context
- **Persistence** - Battles persist through bot restarts
- **Discord Compatibility** - Designed to handle Discord's interaction timeouts
- **Resilience** - Error handling and graceful recovery

```python
# Example of Discord command calling the actor system
@app_commands.command(name="battle_move", description="Execute a move in battle")
async def battle_move(self, interaction: discord.Interaction, move_name: str):
    # Defer the response to avoid Discord timeout
    await interaction.response.defer(ephemeral=True)
    
    battle_id = self.get_user_battle(str(interaction.user.id))
    if not battle_id:
        return await interaction.followup.send("You're not in a battle!")
    
    # Get the battle actor through the manager
    battle_ref = self.battle_manager.get_battle(battle_id)
    
    # Send a message to the actor and await response
    result = await battle_ref.ask({
        "action": "execute_move",
        "user_id": str(interaction.user.id),
        "move_name": move_name
    })
    
    # Send the result back to Discord
    await interaction.followup.send(result["message"])
```

#### Battle Metrics and Performance

The system includes comprehensive performance monitoring for Discord interactions:

- **Query Timing** - Database operation tracking
- **Battle Performance** - Metrics on battle duration and complexity
- **User Response Time** - Tracking interaction responsiveness
- **Caching System** - Efficient data retrieval for common operations
- **Automated Optimization** - Background tasks to maintain performance

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🧪 Testing</h3></summary>

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover tests

# Run specific test module
python -m unittest tests.test_battle_system
```

#### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests** - Core game mechanics and calculations
- **Integration Tests** - Database operations and state management
- **Mock Testing** - Discord API interactions with simulated responses
- **Performance Testing** - Load testing for multi-battle scenarios
